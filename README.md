# To Do App

This friday project was developed at the *Neue Fische* Bootcamp Cologne. It should help us understand the basic fundamentals of React. As a technology stack we used javascript, webpack, eslint, prettier and of course react. We didnt use tests, because it was all about understanding of hooks and usage of localStorage with datatypes
